# CCS-v3
or Calorie Counter Simpler version 3

This is a project that is a direct upgrade from my old Execl sheet that i called CCS v1 and v2. which ran fine.
But i was inspired by a colleague at work to write my own program, i wrote it in VB.net specifically we mentioned it alot during an incident... least its very similar to C#, which im considering to write it in... One Day... so i can write that on my CV too.

This program is specifically made for my needs, its not perfect (Duh), im still learning. If you see anything bad or could have been done better, it because it was in super early stage of writing the code, or felt it was good enough.
I try to comment and give variables names that make sense for its intended purpose, of course its not perfect in your mind, but when i was im the time making this, it kinda was.
Some extra features are added mostly because its great to have, should i ever need it (like body measurement, or recipe book), considering its targetet towards people who want to control their caloric intake
See https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/ for more about calories and stuff

The UI is made on the fly, i am not a designer, but i do try to keep things where it make sense, like the Delete button should not be close to the submit button, keeping things simple with proper names, have the importent and often used objects on the correct side with the relevant details, and more details thats usually not looked at somewhere else.

As per today (07.06.2022) i haven't been working on it, as it mostly complete to a level i'm satisfied with, i may work on it all the sudden, depending on my motivation

# FAQ
- Why not use already existing apps like MyFitnessPal?
  - I tried it in the past (6 years ago), and i really didnt like it, the app was already target towards North Americans, which used Footballfields per Washing, which is a pain to messure stuff with when we use Metrics (kinda of a joke), there was too many items, none which were in Norway, making them a waste of space (in my situation).
- Was this made with the expectation for it to be made public?
  - Yes and no, i know for sure if it made a joke everywhere in the code and want to change it within a year of not touching it, i wouldn't understand anything. But if others feel like they could benifit using this software, then sure.
- Do you take suggestions that may not be usefull for you, but for me?
  - Sure, if its relevant and not too complicated, like solving world hunger.
- Do you plan to make any other front ends, such as web or mobile app?
  - Sounds like a interesting project, im not sure yet. But the idea is not out of the window completely
